# DIY Personal Yearly Goal Tracker

New Year, New Resolution and hopefully New Me!!

This has been my go to goal for past couple of years, after reading about
people‚Äôs inspirational stories of changing themselves over a course of year,
especially reading [The Happiness
Project](https://gretchenrubin.com/books/the-happiness-project/about-the-book/)
by Gretchen Rubin. She regularly writes entries describing her goals, habits and
changes she observed once she started following them. All this sounded very
enticing to me and I tried the same. Alas, *laziness has no limits. *January was
the only month wherein the journal entries were made in the Google Sheet that I
had created.

Though this definitely helped me pick up the habit of waking early everyday
since I was journal-ing and hence actively keeping a track of my sleep. The
active tracking and the constant reminder (when I missed my sleep) was great
motivating factor for me to stick to my schedule. I truly believe that a habit
can be formed if you stick to it for[ 21 days](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit)
(and more).

Things I tried to keep active track of new habits and how I failed

* Journal ‚Äî I don‚Äôt like writing everyday. Also, I travel a lot and hence the
journal was in most of the cases ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô home.
* Android Apps ‚Äî I don‚Äôt like writing everyday, like seriously I don‚Äôt. Also, the
annoying notification glaring in my face for a ‚Äòquick‚Äô check up does not help.
If anything it almost becomes a ‚Äòhabit‚Äô to ignore it.

Calendar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar)</span>

While browsing through KickStarter (best work-time distraction) I came across
[Simone Giertz‚Äôs everyday
calendar,](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar)
which is an amazing gadget to have to keep a track of your habit. It literally
gives you a golden star every day you are successful in performing the task you
want to make a habit of. I really loved the idea of having this calendar of
sorts, because

* Its a constant reminder of how well you are (or aren‚Äôt) doing and personally I
think its a good source of motivation to *keep that streak of gold stars going
on*.
* Its way less obtrusive (than the irritating reminder from App) and easier (you
have to just tap) to make it work.
* I love how geeky it is!

So, I decided to make a smaller version of the same for my own, and rather than
having the entire year, I decided to showcase my efforts for the last 7 days to
keep me motivated!

The design goals for the same were-

* Small form factor
* DIY and easy to code
* Multiple habits in One!

So, I took a raspberry-pi (üòç) along with an [Adafruit
Bonnet](https://medium.com/www.adafruit.com/product/3531) (Its a add on board
with screen and a couple of buttons).

I wrote some code which basically shows

* Today‚Äôs Date
* Number of days left to the Next New Year‚Äôs (This is configurable though) ‚Äî This
helps me stay on track with a constant reminder if I am doing well or not!
* List 2 habits that I want to keep a track of.
* Show me the progress for the last 7 days. (X means Yes, ‚Äî Means No)

The way this works is I click up arrow (habit ‚Äî 1) and right arrow (habit ‚Äî 2)
everyday if I have done them in the previous day. I like to keep this in my
washroom near my toothbrush. This way I can update the daily log. I tried
keeping it near my bed, but I think that‚Äôs way too much pressure to handle the
log every night!

The code for the raspberry pi is kept here.

Feel free to send a PR or clone it to improve its working! Some of the next
goals that I want to integrate in this are

* Make the tracking Icons cuter
* Add a quote of the day at the empty place on the screen

Special thanks to [Simone
Giertz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KEoMzNz8eYnwBC34RaKCQ) (do follow her
on YT) and I hope she gets well soon!
