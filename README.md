The design goals for the same were-

* Small form factor
* DIY and easy to code
* Multiple habits in One!

So, I took a raspberry-pi (üòç) along with an [Adafruit
Bonnet](https://medium.com/www.adafruit.com/product/3531) (Its a add on board
with screen and a couple of buttons).

I wrote some code which basically shows

* Today‚Äôs Date
* Number of days left to the Next New Year‚Äôs (This is configurable though) ‚Äî This
helps me stay on track with a constant reminder if I am doing well or not!
* List 2 habits that I want to keep a track of.
* Show me the progress for the last 7 days. (X means Yes, ‚Äî Means No)

The way this works is I click up arrow (habit ‚Äî 1) and right arrow (habit ‚Äî 2)
everyday if I have done them in the previous day. I like to keep this in my
washroom near my toothbrush. This way I can update the daily log. I tried
keeping it near my bed, but I think that‚Äôs way too much pressure to handle the
log every night!

The code for the raspberry pi is kept here.

Feel free to send a PR or clone it to improve its working! Some of the next
goals that I want to integrate in this are

* Make the tracking Icons cuter
* Add a quote of the day at the empty place on the screen

Special thanks to [Simone
Giertz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KEoMzNz8eYnwBC34RaKCQ) (do follow her
on YT) and I hope she gets well soon!
